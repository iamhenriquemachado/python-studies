# Contact List App

## Description
This is a simple Contact List application built in Python to practice functions and modules. The app allows users to add, view, search, update, and delete contacts. The contacts are stored in a JSON file to maintain persistence.

## Features
- Add new contacts (name, phone, email, address)
[x] View all contacts
[x] Search for a contact by name
[x] Update contact details
[x] Delete a contact
[x] Store contacts in a JSON file for data persistence

## Technologies Used
- Python (3.x)
- JSON for data storage

## Requirements
- Python 3.x installed
- JSON file (`contacts.json`) for storing contact data

## Installation
1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Install any necessary dependencies (none required for basic functionality).

## Usage
1. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python contact_list.py
   ```
2. Follow the menu prompts to interact with the contact list.
3. Contacts will be saved automatically in `contacts.json`.

## Future Improvements
- Add GUI using Tkinter or PyQt
- Implement a database (SQLite) instead of JSON
- Add phone number and email validation
- Allow sorting contacts alphabetically
